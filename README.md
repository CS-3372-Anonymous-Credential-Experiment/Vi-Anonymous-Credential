# Vi-Anonymous-Credential

This project implements a prototype of an anonymous credential issuance system using a bilinear pairing-based accumulator, designed to support an allow-list mechanism for revoking credentials and preventing misuse.

The accumulator logic is currently being updated based on the model proposed by Flamini et al. (2025).

We aim at the credential revocation problem by using 2 approach - using the Membership test by proving secret witness doesn't belong to self-reconstruct merkel-tree from holder's bases on issuer's provided data; another approach was using ZK-SNARK to prove holder's credential not contain within the accumulator (by using the idea of Flamini with some hashing as the mapping from Bls12-381 eliptic-curve to BN-256 curves's point - for smart-contract adaptability)

For proving holder's attribute, we aiming leverage the idea of linear-size scaling bulletproof (in the future ones can using the log-size scaling bulletproof) to enhance the credential's proving issurance.

With Issuer - we imply the trust between the Issuer & Holder's credential (acceptance some linkability risk), but no more trust imply can be enforce within this setting - This would be suitable to the centralization setting as Government Credential Issurance, e-ID

## ðŸ”§ Project Components


### ðŸ§© Accumulator Implementation (accumulator_impl)
Represents the core bilinear pairing-based accumulator structure.  
Includes logic for initializing, updating, and testing accumulator behavior via a simple `main` function.
Include the Holder, Issuer, some objects relate to credential-issurance
Using BBS+ signature scheme & Pedersent system for the messeage hidding

### ZK-SNARK memebership accumulator testing (snark_mem_acc) 
Implement the ZK-SNARK in ZKP-prove generation (the process of prove generate was off-chain - follow by Flamini <2025>) , but to adapt on-chain enviroment,
modification as Hahsing the BLS12-381 cryptographic object was implement by using Poseident hashing and SHA-256 bit-mapping to BN-256 was uses to adapt to 
current environemt & support library


### BulletProof (BulletProof/bulletproof-bls12 - In-Progress)
Using the Bulletproof (with linear-scaling proof size) for generating ZKP-Challenge to Prover

### Some other up-comming update: 
- Adding the Merkel Hashing Tree as another implementation for Revocation Problem
- On-chain EVM deployment of the Credential Verification
